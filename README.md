# AppleNews_VIP

The app is made using CleanSwift.
It is a tabbar application with two tabs:
- the Articles tab which grabs a list of articles about Apple from an API 
-   it also contains a details view controller 
- the About tab

The API used for this project:
https://newsapi.org/

Pods used:
- Moya for API requests
- Kingfisher for image downloading


Some of the data looks wonky but it comes like that from the API, a lot of sentences end in "..."
